 * - Player number display (Player X of Y)
 * - Different card styling for spies (spy-card vs game-card)
 * - Your original spy message and styling
 * - Your original location/role display format
 *
 * The screen handles two different cases:
 * 1. Regular players: Shows their location and specific role
 * 2. Spy players: Shows spy message with different styling
